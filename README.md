### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just moved here from BitBucket.  
My main public project is my [photo portfolio](https://github.com/wiesesamuel/laravel_photography).  
You can take a look at the [demo](https://wiesesamuel.de). But all programmers know, that the most beautiful part lays in the [backend](https://github.com/wiesesamuel/laravel_photography). :wink:
